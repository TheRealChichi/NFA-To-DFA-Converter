# 🧠 NFA to DFA Converter (Python GUI)

A Python GUI application that converts a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA), including ε-transitions, into an equivalent Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) using the classical subset construction algorithm.

Created by **Kevin Truong & Raymond Rapglia** for the course **MCS 5243 - Theory of Computation** under **Dr. Khalid Khanfar**.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Simple and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter
- ✅ Accepts ε-transitions (lambda transitions)
- ✅ Automatically computes ε-closures
- ✅ Applies subset construction to convert NFA → DFA
- ✅ Shows final DFA states, transitions, and structure
